## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 

daly_plot <- ggplot(data_overall_mini, aes(x = Year, y = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "DALY Burden Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "DALY Rate (Age-standardized)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

## Summary of Overall Disease Burden Findings

The chart shows a clear decline in DALY rates over time for all three countries. Bangladesh demonstrates the most consistent and steep reduction in disease burden, while Botswana shows a sharp increase until the early 2000s followed by a significant decline. Afghanistanâ€™s burden remains relatively high but gradually decreases over the years.
